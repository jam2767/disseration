Tree ring bayesian hierarchical mixed effects model
========================================================

The tree ring analysis to-date has included a hierarchical structure to include individuals, subplots, plots and sites and some individual effects like species. I am now adding year x plot and year x site interactions to see how much variance is explained by climate at each site and within a site.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **Help** toolbar button for more details on using R Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```

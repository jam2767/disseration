Tree ring bayesian hierarchical mixed effects model
========================================================

The tree ring analysis to-date has included a hierarchical structure to include individuals, subplots, plots and sites and some individual effects like species. I am now adding year x plot and year x site interactions to see how much variance is explained by climate at each site and within a site.

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#Example creating interaction term
Y = seq(1,10)
L = as.vector(x=c("A","B","C"))
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```
